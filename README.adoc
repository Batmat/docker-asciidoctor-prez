= Docker Asciidoctor Image with support for building presentations (slides)

Currently supports at least Deck.js.

== How to use it

By default, the image will try to process a file named _prez.adoc_.
To override that, pass the PREZ variable to give your presentation name.

Example :

    $ docker run -e PREZ=demo-deckjs.adoc -v `pwd`:/documents batmat/asciidoctor-prez

Then browse the .html generated file. 

Note : for the demo to work, you'll need to clone the deck.js repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js.git .deck.js

== Details

This docker image is based on the official asciidoctor/docker-asciidoctor image.
